This command creates custom jars that we can share with customers.

#### Parameters

- **ref** - the branch/tag/hash that should be checked out to generate the jar;

### Z - Sandbox job

This is a hello world workflow to allow development of new workflows without pushing a new blank workflow to `main`.
