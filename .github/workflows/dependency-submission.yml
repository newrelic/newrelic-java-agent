# Workflow: Dependency Graph Submission and Vulnerability Reporting
#
# Trigger: This workflow runs on every merge to the main branch.
#
# Purpose: It generates and submits a dependency graph to the GitHub Dependency Submission API. The graph is used to
# trigger Dependabot Alerts for vulnerable dependencies, and to populate the Dependency Graph insights view in GitHub.
#
# Excludes:
# - Test-only dependencies
