- Do an `instanceof` check in the `complete()` method prior to class cast  [1719](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1719)
- Null check on the response object prior to trying to report an external call [1719](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1719)

## Deprecations

- The browser footer injection APIs have been deprecated and will be removed in a future agent release. The header injection API now adds both the header and footer scripts. [1679](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1679)

The following instrumentation modules are deprecated and will be removed in the next major release:

- `aws-wrap-0.7.0`
- `java.completable-future-jdk8`
- `play-2.3`
- `spring-3.0.0`
- `netty-3.4`
- `Struts v1`

## Version 8.9.0
## New features and improvements

- Instrumentation for Spring Webclient 5/6 now captures http status code and http status message [1658](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1658)
- Add status code to `grpc-1.40.0` client instrumentation  [1673](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1673)
- Add config to set the size limit of attributes on custom events (i.e. `newrelic.config.custom_insights_events.max_attribute_value`). Default size is `255` characters and the max is `4095`. [1683](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1683)
- Add Spring instrumentation modules to support proper transaction naming (route + HTTP method) of traditional annotated spring controllers as well as controllers that inherit annotations from interfaces, super classes or custom annotations. Note that because the new instrumentation can change transaction names, enabling this "enhanced transaction naming" is gated by the `newrelic.config.class_transformer.enhanced_spring_transaction_naming` agent configuration option, which is `false` by default. Thanks to @mgr32 for their help with validating the naming changes. [1675](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1675)
- Add instrumentation for Vert.x 4.5.x web client and futures [1704](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1704)

## Fixes

- Remove erroneous printing of stack trace in `SlowTransactionManager` [1684](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1684)
- Convert the `ProcessPointCut` over to a weaver instrumentation module to better handle cases where it is used in a multi-threaded environment. [1685](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1685)

## Removals

- Remove support for setting agent config with rarely used lower-case, dotted environment variable names (e.g. `newrelic.config.labels`). Customers relying on lower-case, dotted environment variables should switch to the standard upper-case, underscore names (e.g. `NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_LABELS`). There are no changes to documented system property behavior (via `newrelic.config.`, server-side config, YAML, or standard environment variable (via `NEW_RELIC_`). [1598](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1598)

## Deprecations

- The browser footer injection APIs have been deprecated and will be removed in a future agent release. The header injection API now adds both the header and footer scripts. [1679](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1679)

The following instrumentation modules are deprecated and will be removed in the next major release:

- `aws-wrap-0.7.0`
- `java.completable-future-jdk8`
- `play-2.3`
- `spring-3.0.0`
- `netty-3.4`
- `Struts v1`

## IAST
- Update Security Agent to Public Release version `1.1.0` [1710](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1710)
- Changelog: https://github.com/newrelic/csec-java-agent/releases/tag/1.1.0

## Version 8.8.1
## Fixes

* Fixed a `NullPointerException` when working with Synthetics headers [1690](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1690)

## Deprecations

The following instrumentation modules are deprecated and will be removed in the next major release:

- `aws-wrap-0.7.0`
- `java.completable-future-jdk8`
- `play-2.3`
- `spring-3.0.0`
- `netty-3.4`
- `Struts v1`


## Version 8.8.0
## New features and improvements

* Add support for Jetty 12, including Jettyâ€™s implementation of the Jakarta EE 8, 9, and 10 specs. [1621](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1621)
* Add support for Vert.x versions 4.0.0 through 4.4.x [1588](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1588)
* Add instrumentation for graphql-java 21 [1454](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1565)
* Instrument r2dbc-postgresql 0.9.2 till latest [1413](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1556) 
* Reintroduce the legacy HTTP Attributes that were removed in *v8.0.0* to support customers with alerts and dashboards that require them [1671](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1671)
  The attributes are:
  * `httpResponseCode`
  * `httpResponseMessage`
  * `response.status`
  * `response.statusMessage`

  Attribute reporting is configurable via the following means.

  YAML:
  ```
  attributes:
    http_attribute_mode: both
  ```

  System property:
  ```properties
  -Dnewrelic.config.attributes.http_attribute_mode=both
  ```

  Environment variable:
  ```properties
  NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_HTTP_ATTRIBUTE=both 
  ```

  The configuration options are:
  * `standard` : The agent will send new standard attributes. This configuration is recommended but requires that any alerts or dashboards using attributes be updated to use these new attributes. This setting will reduce the amount of ingest used for attribute reporting.
  * `legacy` : The agent will send the legacy attributes referenced above. Customers with alerts or dashboard requiring these attributes can continue to be used as-is.  This setting will reduce the amount of ingest used for attribute reporting.
  * `both` : This is the default configuration, the agent will send BOTH legacy AND standard HTTP attributes. This configuration was intended to support customers that are unable to modify their alerts or dashboards but this configuration will increase data ingest.

* Add an interface for our error API. Our error API can now be called via the code `NewRelic.getAgent().getErrorApi()` [1577](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1579)
* Add log4j2 JsonLayout support and support log4j2 till latest. [1545](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1559)
* Add httpstatus in the external segment for Spring Webclient [1610](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1610)
* Enable slow transaction detection by default and bump the threshold to 10 minutes [1629](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1629)
* Add support for string formatting with JBoss Logging. [1650](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1650) 
* Add logic to remove specific classes from being excluded from being weaved if the IAST security feature is enabled. [1453](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1453)

  The affected classes belong in the following formats:
  * `^java/security/.*` 
  * `^javax/crypto/.*` These are crypto classes which can cause class circularity errors if they get too far along in the class transformer.
  * `^net/sf/saxon.*` 

  If you wish to re-include these excluded rules, you can do so via the following means.

  YAML:
  ```yaml
    class_transformer:
      excludes: ^javax/crypto/.*,^java/security/.*,^net/sf/saxon.*
  ```

  System property:
  ```properties
  -Dnewrelic.config.class_transformer.excludes=^javax/crypto/.*,^java/security/.*,^net/sf/saxon.*
  ```

  Environment variable:
  ```properties
  NEW_RELIC_CLASS_TRANSFORMER_EXCLUDES=^javax/crypto/.*,^java/security/.*,^net/sf/saxon.*
  ```

* Prevent license_key value from being written to the agent logs when using debug and/or audit_mode logging [1653](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1653)

#### IAST 

* The IAST feature now also supports Async HTTP client version 2 and above [142](https://github.com/newrelic/csec-java-agent/pull/142)
* Added support for Sun Net HTTP Server [142](https://github.com/newrelic/csec-java-agent/pull/142)
* JSON version bump to 1.1.1 [142](https://github.com/newrelic/csec-java-agent/pull/142)
* Add critical error logging via LogMessage event [142](https://github.com/newrelic/csec-java-agent/pull/142)

## Fixes

* Fix transaction naming in Spring controllers with a CGLIB proxy. Transactions now use the actual class name as opposed to the proxied class name.  [1574](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1575)
* Fix a `NullPointerException` caused by ServletContext in servlet instrumentation modules. [1636](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1636)
* Fix a memory leak caused by Lettuce instrumentation. Duplicate code for  transaction linking has been removed from the Lettuce instrumentation and is handled by netty-reactor instead. [1608](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1608)
* Fix a bug where invalidating a license key causes a memory leak. Reconnection tasks are now capped in the event of a `LicenseException`.   [1606](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1606)
* Fix a `NullPointerException` caused by RPMServiceManager [1604](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1604)
* Add a workaround for a memory leak that may occur in rare scenarios with instrumentation using the legacy async API in the Java Agent (which async servlets and Jetty Continuations use). [1555](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1555)

  The option can be configured via the following means:

  Agent config file (this will update dynamically if the config file is changed)
  ```yaml
  common: &default_settings
    legacy_async_api_skip_suspend: true
  ```

  System Property
  ```properties
  -Dnewrelic.config.legacy_async_api_skip_suspend=true
  ```

  Environment Variable
  ```properties
  NEW_RELIC_LEGACY_ASYNC_API_SKIP_SUSPEND=true
  ```

#### IAST

* DynamoDB v2 issue: missing attribute values for conditionCheck method in case of transactWriteItems operation on DynamoDB [142](https://github.com/newrelic/csec-java-agent/pull/142)

* Fixed an Insecure cookie attack vulnerability.  [142](https://github.com/newrelic/csec-java-agent/pull/142)
* Never print LicenseKey [142](https://github.com/newrelic/csec-java-agent/pull/142)

## Deprecations

The following instrumentation modules are deprecated and will be removed in the next major release:

- `aws-wrap-0.7.0`
- `java.completable-future-jdk8`
- `play-2.3`
- `spring-3.0.0`
- `netty-3.4`

E.g:
  ```yaml
  slow_transactions:
    enabled: true
    threshold: 1000 # The threshold is measured in milliseconds
  ```
*  Add instrumentation for r2dbc postgresql 0.9.2 to 0.9.x [1410](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1410)
* Security Agent: Add new configuration to enable/disable low priority instrumentation `security.low-priority-instrumentation.enabled` for the CSEC agent. Default value is false. [1515](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1515)

## Fixes

* Fixed a bug where a ClassCircularityError was thrown by Sonarqube9.9 [1522](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1522)
* Fix a bug where the Java agent fails to detect `spring-security-oauth2-client.jar` [1462](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1462)
* Fix a bug where Spring 6/ Spring Boot3 does not report underlying exception/stacktrace when a @RestControllerAdvice class is used [1538](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1538)
* Fix HttpUrlConnection instrumentation so segment timing is accurate [1537](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1537)
* Fixes a bug in Spring 6 instrumentation where transactions are incorrectly named in certain scenarios. [1544](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1544)
Such include: 
  * "built-in" controllers that don't have `@RestController`-like annotations, e.g. /actuator/health (see [Actuator endpoints](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#actuator.endpoints))
  * custom controllers that don't use `@RestController `directly (e.g. using custom annotations)
  * requests returning 401s / 404s
* Add a fix for JBoss EAP / Wildfly where if customers are using the J2EE/Jakarta Management API, the application fails to startup. [1549](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1549) 
  This is done by adding the system property `com.newrelic.jboss.jsr77.fix` and setting it to `true`. 
  E.g. 
  ```
  -Dcom.newrelic.jboss.jsr77.fix=true
  ``` 
  Customers using JBoss EAP 7.4+ or Wildfly 23+ will need to manually configure the `io.undertow.servlet` module and add 
  `java.management` as a dependency. 
  This translates to doing the following steps: 
  1. Opening the file `modules/system/layers/base/io/undertow/servlet/main/module.xml` 
  2. Adding the XML element `<module name="java.management"/>` inside the body of the `<dependencies>` tag
  
  Here is what the configured XML file may look like:
  ```xml
  <module name="io.undertow.servlet" xmlns="urn:jboss:module:1.9">
      <resources>
          <resource-root path="undertow-servlet-2.2.5.Final-redhat-00001.jar"/>
      </resources>

      <dependencies>
          <module name="javax.annotation.api"/>
          <module name="sun.jdk"/>
          <module name="javax.servlet.api"/>
          <module name="javax.servlet.jsp.api"/>
          <module name="javax.servlet.jstl.api"/>
          <module name="org.jboss.logging"/>
          <module name="io.undertow.core"/>
          <module name="org.jboss.xnio"/>
          <module name="jdk.unsupported"/>
          <module name="java.management"/>
      </dependencies>
  </module>
  ```
* Resolve missing class exception on Scala instrumentation [1528](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1528)
* Security Agent: Fixed ClassNotFoundException for IOStreamHelper class with Glassfish [122](https://github.com/newrelic/csec-java-agent/pull/122) 

## Security

* Update agent dependency commons-codec to v1.13 [1548](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1548)
* Update JFR daemon to `1.11.1`. This upgrade updates the underlying OkHttp dependency to version `4.12.0` [1561](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1561)


## Deprecations

The following instrumentation modules will be removed in the next major release:
- `aws-wrap-0.7.0`
- `java.completable-future-jdk8`
- `play-2.3`
- `spring-3.0.0`
- `netty-3.4`

- Spring Cache instrumentation [#1458](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/issues/1458)

This new instrumentation module allows you to see how your caches are performing. It provides hit/miss metrics as well as clear and evict.
Search "Metrics Explorer" for the new metrics:
```
Cache/Spring/<cache-provider>/<cache-name>/hits
Cache/Spring/<cache-provider>/<cache-name>/misses
Cache/Spring/<cache-provider>/<cache-name>/clear
Cache/Spring/<cache-provider>/<cache-name>/evict
```

- Kafka client node metrics [#1338](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/issues/1338)

This is a new instrumentation for Kafka clients. It provides metrics similar to the existing instrumentation module, but this provides them by node/topic, whereas the existing one only uses topic. This module is disabled by default, check its documentation for more information.

- Kafka client config events [#1338](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/issues/1338)

This new instrumentation module sends the Kafka configuration as events periodically.

- Improved Struts 2 instrumentation [#1457](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/issues/1457)

The Struts 2 instrumentation has been refactored to use a newer instrumentation technique, which allows it to be disabled.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/compare/v8.1.0...v8.2.0

## Version 8.1.0 
### New features and improvements

- Added support for Webflux 6 [1181](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1181)

- Added support for Spring JMS 6 [1088](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/issues/1088)

- Added support for Mongodb Reactive Streams [1164](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1164)

- Added support for Kafka Streams [1170](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1170)

  Support for Kafka Streams comes in two flavors, metrics and spans. Metrics are enabled by default, while spans are disabled by default. To enable spans add the following to your _newrelic.yml_ configuration under the common stanza:
```
common:
  class_transformer:
    kafka-streams-spans:
      enabled: true
```

- Error fingerprint - supply your own errors inbox group names [1195](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1195)

  Are your error occurrences grouped poorly? Set your own error fingerprint via a callback function. A new public API method has been added that will accept a user defined proc. The proc will be invoked for each noticed error and whenever it returns a string, that string will be used as the error group name for the error and will take precedence over any server-side grouping that takes place with the New Relic errors inbox. This gives users much greater control over the grouping of their errors. For more information check our [API: Error Grouping](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/api-guides/java-agent-api-register-error-group-callback-to-set-fingerprint/) and [APM: Group errors tab](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/errors-inbox/apm-tab/) pages.

- User tracking [1188](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1188)

  You can now see the number of users impacted by an error group. Identify the end user with a new public API method that will accept a string representation of a user id and associate that user id with the current transaction. Transactions and errors will then have a new `enduser.id` agent attribute associated with them. This will allow agent users to tag transactions and errors as belonging to given user ids in support of greater filtering and alerting capabilities. For more information check the [Newrelic.setUserId ](https://newrelic.github.io/java-agent-api/javadoc/com/newrelic/api/agent/NewRelic.html#setUserName(java.lang.String) documentation and the [Track users impacted with errors inbox](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/errors-inbox/error-users-impacted/) page.

- Invoking `token.link()` outside a transaction will instrument that method to start an async transaction [1140](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1140)

- The Kafka clients instrumentation has new metrics to list the nodes: `MessageBroker/Kafka/Nodes/&lt;node>` [1130](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1130)

* Support log forwarding for java.util.logging (JUL) [1049](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1049)

#### Support forwarding log context data [866](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/866)
The agent can now forward data in Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC, logback/slf4j) and ThreadContext (log4j2) as attributes when forwarding log records. When the feature is enabled, these attributes will be added to the log records with a `context.` prefix. For details on how to enable this feature see the documentation for [context_data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file/#logging-context-data).

#### Custom Event Limit Increase  [1036](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1036)
  This version increases the default limit of custom events from 10,000 events per minute to 30,000 events per minute. In the scenario that custom events were being limited, this change will allow more custom events to be sent to New Relic. There is also a new configurable maximum limit of 100,000 events per minute. To change the limits, see the documentation for [max_samples_stored](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file/#Custom_Events). To learn more about the change and how to determine if custom events are being dropped, see our Explorers Hub post.

#### Code-level metrics on by default [1037](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/1037)
  The code-level metrics functionality introduced with agent 7.10 is now enabled by default. This feature will cause an increase in the consumption of data. The amount depends on the application. To disable code-level metrics, see instructions on our [code-level metrics documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#code-level-metrics).

#### Code level metrics

For traced methods in automatic instrumentation or from @Trace annotations, the agent is now capable of reporting metrics with method-level granularity. When the new functionality is enabled, the agent will associate source-code-related metadata with some metrics. Then, when the corresponding Java class file that defines the methods is loaded up in a [New Relic CodeStream](https://www.codestream.com/)-powered IDE, [the four golden signals](https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/) for each method will be presented to the developer directly.

#### Agent log forwarding now adds the following attributes to log events for the log4j2 and logback1.2 frameworks:

thread.name
thread.id
logger.name
logger.fqcn
error.class
error.stack
error.message

### Fixes
Fixed an issue with Distributed Tracing headers not being added on external requests made with the HttpUrlConnection client

### Support statement
New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/).

## Version 7.4.0 (2021-10-28)

### New features and improvements

* Support for Java 17 [#433](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/433)

* Distributed Tracing is on by Default and deprecates Cross Application Tracing [#486](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/486)
  - Increases the default maximum number of samples stored for Span Events from 1000 to 2000.
  - The maximum number of samples stored for Span Events can be configured via the max_samples_stored configuration in the newrelic.yml.
  ```
  span_events:
    max_samples_stored: 2000
  ```
  **Notice:** This feature will cause an increase in the consumption of data. The amount depends on the application. This feature can be disabled by adding the following to the agent yaml config nested under the common stanza:
  ```
  distributed_tracing:
    enabled: false
  ```

* Auto-instrumentation Support for GraphQL-Java 17.0+ [#487](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/487)
* This version tested agent support for the ARM64/Graviton2 platform


### Fixes
The existing MongoDB sync client instrumentation was incorrectly applying when MongoDB reactive or async client was being used, which could lead to segment timeouts and long transaction response times. [#476](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/476)

### Deprecations/Removed Features
Cross Application Tracing is now deprecated, and disabled by default. To continue using it, enable it with `cross_application_tracer.enabled = true` and `distributed_tracing.enabled = false`.

## Version 7.1.1 (2021-7-15)

 Due to overhead caused in some applications [Real-time profiling for Java using JFR metrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/features/real-time-profiling-java-using-jfr-metrics/)
is now disabled by default.

It can be enabled following the instructions [here](#enabling-jfr).


## Version 7.1.0 (2021-7-7)

### Known issue
Some customers saw increased overhead when Real-time profiling is enabled.
See instructions to disable Real-time profiling in the [notice](#disabling-jfr) below.

### New features and improvements:

* Java instrumentation by XML new properties [#288](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/288)
  * traceLambda - to trace lambdas inside a method
  * traceByReturnType - to trace all methods in a class that return a given type

  These are compatible with Java and Scala. For more information, see
  [Java instrumentation by XML](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/custom-instrumentation/java-instrumentation-xml/).


* Scala APIs [#254](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/254)

  New artifacts allow Scala code to be instrumented using a fluent Scala API
  instead of the Java annotations. There are specific artifacts for versions
  2.10, 2.11, 2.12, 2.13 of Scala. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 artifact.

  For more information, see
  [Scala instrumentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/frameworks/scala-installation-java/).


* Real-time profiling for Java using JFR metrics  [#333](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/333)

  [Real-time profiling for Java using JFR metrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/features/real-time-profiling-java-using-jfr-metrics/)
  is now enabled by default.

  **Notice:** this feature will cause an increase in the consumption of data.
  The amount depends on the application. <a id="disabling-jfr"></a> It can be disabled by adding the
  following to the agent yaml config nested under the `common` stanza:
  
  ```
    jfr:
      enabled: false
  ```
  For more information, see
  [JFR core README](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-jfr-core/blob/main/README.md).

## Version 7.0.1 (2021-6-15)

### Fixes

* Fixes an issue where the agent would break OkHttp versions 3.X and lower. [#324](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/issues/324)


## Version 7.0.0 (2021-6-9)

### New features and improvements:

* Real-time profiling for Java using JFR metrics  
  [Real-time profiling for Java using JFR metrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/features/real-time-profiling-java-using-jfr-metrics/) is now fully integrated into the Java agent. See the [JFR core README](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-jfr-core/blob/main/README.md) for additional details.
  
  <a id="enabling-jfr"></a>
  This feature requires a supported version of Java (Java 8 (specifically version `8u262`+) or Java 11+) and is currently disabled by default. To enable it set the following in your yaml (indented 2 spaces under the common stanza).

    ```
      jfr:
        enabled: true
    ```
    
    **Notice:** If you were previously using the [jfr-daemon jar](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-jfr-core) as an agent extension or standalone process you should remove that option to avoid potential conflicts with the JFR service that is now built into the agent.

* Not compatible with Java 7  
  In order to continue to innovate and efficiently provide new capabilities to our customers who run on the JVM, this and future agent versions are not compatible with Java 7. If you are running Java 7, you may continue to use Java agent 6.5.0 or lower. For details, see this topic on the [Explorers Hub](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-upcoming-changes-to-capabilities-across-synthetics-apm-java-php-infrastructure-mobile-agents-health-maps-statsd-and-legacy-dashboards/147982).

* Adds support for akka http with Scala 2.13 [#271](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/271)

* Class annotation to trace lambda methods [#274](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/274)

* Class annotation to trace methods by return type [#275](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/275)

### Fixes:

* Fixes an issue that could cause multiple versions of `akka-http-core` instrumentation to apply at the same time. [#208](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/208)

* The agent will now log dropped events at `FINE` instead of `WARN` to decrease verbosity. [#296](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/296)

* Fixes Javadoc comments that incorrectly stated that, when calling the `noticeError` API multiple times, the first error would be reported when in fact it is the last error that is reported. [#313](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/313)

### Support statement:

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/).

## Version 6.5.0 (2021-4-26)

### New Features and Improvements:
* The agent no longer bundles SSL certificates with it and the `use_private_ssl` option that configured the agent to use
  the previously bundled certificates has been removed. By default, the agent will use the SSL truststore provided by 
  the JVM unless it is explicitly configured to use a different truststore with the ca_bundle_path option. See
  [Configuring your SSL certificates](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/configuring-your-ssl-certificates/)
  for more details.
  ([#245](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/245))

### Fixes:
* Fixes an issue that could cause incorrect transaction naming when using JAX-RS sub-resources.
  ([#234](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/234))
* Reactor Netty instrumentation improvements and fixes.
  ([#237](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/237),
  [#239](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/239),
  [#243](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/243))

### Deprecation Notice

* Java 7 compatibility deprecation

In order to continue to innovate and efficiently provide new capabilities to our customers who run on the JVM, Java 7 
support has been deprecated and this will be the last version of the agent compatible with it.

If you are running Java 7, you may continue to use Java agent 6.5.0 or lower.

For more information, see the [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-upcoming-changes-to-capabilities-across-synthetics-apm-java-php-infrastructure-mobile-agents-health-maps-statsd-and-legacy-dashboards/147982).

## Version 6.4.0 (2021-1-27)

### New Features and Improvements:
* Spring Webflux/Netty Reactor instrumentation improvements for enhanced tracing across asynchronous thread hops
([#174](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/174), [#190](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/190),
[#195](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/195)).
* Infinite tracing will now utilize a backoff sequence on retries. ([#180](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/180))
* New distributed tracing APIs have been added to better support general use cases for
propagating distributed tracing headers. In particular the new APIs provide enhanced support for [W3C Trace Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) but
are flexible enough to support other header protocols. Previous distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and are subject to removal in a
future agent release. See [documentation here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/api-guides/guide-using-java-agent-api#trace-calls).
([#188](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/188))
  * [`Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers)`](https://newrelic.github.io/java-agent-api/javadoc/com/newrelic/api/agent/Transaction.html#insertDistributedTraceHeaders(com.newrelic.api.agent.Headers))
is used to create and insert distributed tracing headers (both newrelic and W3C Trace Context) into a `Headers` data structure.
  * [`Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers)`](https://newrelic.github.io/java-agent-api/javadoc/com/newrelic/api/agent/Transaction.html#acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(com.newrelic.api.agent.TransportType,com.newrelic.api.agent.Headers))
  is used to accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace.

### Fixes:
* Updated the Java agentâ€™s snakeyaml dependency to 1.27. ([#182](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/182))
* In some environments the jar collector service could lead to high CPU utilization at application startup.
The agent now provides a configurable rate limiter, with a reasonable default, for processing jars detected in the applicationâ€™s environment.
See [documentation here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#jar-collector).
([#183](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/183))

  [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/).

## Version 6.3.0 (2020-12-17)

### New Features and Improvements:
* [Adds support for Spring Webflux 5.3.+](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/121).
* [Adds configuration for ignoring netty reactor errors](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/130). The relevant configuration property is `reactor-netty.errors.enabled`. Error reporting is enabled by default.
* Adds support for [Scala 2.13](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/109), including [Akka Http](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/149) and [Play](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/94). Thank you [junder31](https://github.com/junder31) for these contributions.

### Fixes:
* The netty-4.0.8 instrumentation would [sometimes not start a Transaction on `channelRead`](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/148), potentially affecting instrumentation dependent on it including: Spring, Akka and Play.
* Updates the Java agentâ€™s [Apache HttpClient dependency to 5.13](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/145).
* Spring Webclient could report the [wrong URL when multiple HTTP calls to several URLs occurred in parallel](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/129). Thank you [veklov](https://github.com/veklov) for contributing this fix.

### Support statement:
* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and
  performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach
  [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/).

## Version 6.2.1 (2020-11-17)
[Fixes an issue where Spring-Webflux applications with endpoints returning no or empty content could become unresponsive](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/115)

## Version 6.2.0 (2020-11-10)

### New Features and Improvements:
* **Support for Real Time Profiling of your JVMs.** The agent can now run in parallel with the JFR Daemon to provide Realtime Profiling of your JVMs using Java Flight Recorder! Read more about it in our [blog](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/real-time-java-profiling/) and  [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/features/real-time-profiling-java-using-jfr-metrics).
* [The agent now supports parsing cgroup ids that do not contain `docker-`](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/87). Previously, the agent only supported docker cgroup ids that contained `docker-` in them, such as `1:cpu:/system.slice/docker-12345abcde.scope`. The agent now supports parsing cgroup ids such as `1:cpu:/system.slice/crio-12345abcde.scope`.
* [Adds support for Akka Http Core 10.2.0](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/90). Thank you [jobicarter](https://github.com/jobicarter) for reporting this issue.
* [Adds support for gRPC 1.30.0](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/92). Thank you [jef](https://github.com/jef) for submitting this request and trying it out.
* [Adds support for `map` and `flatmap` async external calls in spring webflux framework](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/93).  Previously the agent didnâ€™t support client calls that occurred within the `map` or `flatmap` methods within the spring webflux framework. External calls such as `serviceB` and `serviceC` in the example below would not get reported to New Relic:
```
    return serviceA.getData()
                .map(service -> Response.builder().service(service).build())
                .flatMap(serviceB::getData)
                .flatMap(serviceC::getData)
                .doOnNext(this::saveResponse);
```
* [Adds support for Play 2.16.3](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/97). Many thanks to [junder31](https://github.com/junder31) for this contribution.

### Fixes:
* [Prevents the agent from logging a timeout exception when using New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing but the agent hasnâ€™t sent spans in a while](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/76).
* [Prevents the agent from logging a socket exception when trying to retrieve cloud provider information in a non-cloud environment](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/80).
* [Adds New Relic EU certifications](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/89) if [`ca_bundle_path` is specified](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/configuring-your-ssl-certificates).
This fix also came with the reintroduction of the `use_private_ssl` config, which can be set to add our agent certs to the truststore.

### Support statement:
* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and
  performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach
  [end-of-life](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/).

## Version 6.1.0 (2020-09-30)
* Support for Java 15
* [Ability to add attributes to segments](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/67)
* `Newrelic.addCustomParameter()` API [now supports boolean values](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/70)
* [Fix a config issue](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/39) where the agent would try to read environment
variables using system-property syntax. It will now log the correct syntax and ignore the incorrect config
* [The Java agent now includes the newrelic.com SSL certificate](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/54).
In previous agent versions, applications using a custom Truststore would have to provide their certificate or use the
`use_private_ssl` configuration which was removed in 6.0.0.
* [Fixed an issue](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/65) where applications could fail to start due to the agent attempting to access the JMX MBean server before it was initialized.

## Version 6.0.0 (2020-08-26)
* Fix for [asynchronous jar file collection](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/20).  Collection
of modules will no longer block the initial first harvest.
* Support for [okhttp 4.4](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/16) instrumentation.
* Fix for `reactor-netty` [verifier versions](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/15)
* [Improve reconnect behavior](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/14) by *not* pinning to preconnected collector host instance.
* Fix race condition around [connection pool exhaustion](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/14) by separating pool timeout from connection timeout. 
* Register an [MBean](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/28) to expose the agent linking metadata.
