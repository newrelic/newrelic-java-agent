Spring Webflux Instrumentation
===============================

This instrumentation assumes that Spring Webflux usage primarily centered 
around maintaining non-blocking flow from the beginning of a request to
the response rendering completion.  If blocking calls occur during the request
handling, it is possible that the agent will lose transaction context and 
transaction naming will not be able to work as intended.  

This is especially likely to happen when using a `ParallelScheduler`
and `@RequestBody` with a parameter that is NOT wrapped in a `Mono` or `Flux`.

For instance:

```java
@PostMapping("/path")
public Mono<String> submit(@RequestBody String body) {
        ...
}
```

When the `@RequestBody` is past as a parameter in this manner, the transaction
naming might show up as `NettyDispatcher`.  If so, simply wrap the 
`RequestBody` parameter in a `Mono` as shown:

```java
@PostMapping("/some/path")
public Mono<String> submit(@RequestBody Mono<String> body) {
        ...
}
```

This should allow the transaction to be named correctly as `some/path (POST)`.

Please see the Spring Webflux documentation for more details on keeping your
code fully non-blocking.
